# Notebook Of Things I Don't Know About

An idea pioneeered by Richard Feynman, the famous American theoretical physicist. As an undergrad, Feynman collected a notebook which he called the "NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DONâ€™T KNOW ABOUT". From his biographer James Gleick, "For the first but not last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject."

So here is my own notebook relating to Machine Learning/Data Science and potentially various other topics.
